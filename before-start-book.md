# A. Preface:
1. This book is not for learning OO concepts or OO languages.
2. We assume you know at least one standard OO language and have experience in OO design.
3. The content is not just what people design at a moment; it contains experiences of developers.
4. Design patterns are the experiences of expert, seasoned developers.
5. The aim of this book is to provide insights that make your design good.
6. **DO NOT** read this book just once; you will need it again and again.

# B. Forward:
1. The quality of an OO system is based on the developer's attention to collaboration among objects. This makes for simple, small, usable, and understandable objects.
2. When do we understand the role of design patterns? When we have a complex system, it has been shown.

# C. Book Structure:
Two parts:
1. What design patterns are and how they help you design object-oriented software.
2. It includes a design case study.
